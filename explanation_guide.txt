	NAME = example

2. compiler
	CC = gcc

3. flags
	CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -Werror

4. source files
	SRC = example.c example2.c example3.c

5. object files
	OBJ_SRC = $(SRC:.c=.o)   [ "$(SRC:.c=.o)" is source files with .c replaced by .o ]

6. rule to compile the program (all is the name of the rule)
	all: $(NAME)  [ "$(NAME)" is the name of the executable file ]

7. rule to compile the program (it compiles the object files and links them)
	$(NAME) : $(OBJ_SRC) 
		$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJ_SRC) -o $@  [ "$@" is the name of the executable file ]

8. rule that says how to make ".o" file from ".c" file
	%.o : %.c
		$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@ [ "$<" is the name of the source file ]

9. rule to clean the object files
	clean :
		rm -f $(OBJ_SRC)

10. rules to clean the object files and the executable file
	fclean : clean
		rm -f $(NAME)

11. rules to recompile the program (it cleans the object files and recompile the program)
	re : fclean all

12. ".PHONY" is to tell make that the rules all, clean, fclean and re are not files
